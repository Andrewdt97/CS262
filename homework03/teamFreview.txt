Review of Team F for homework03

Do their project management materials show the appropriate amount of activity?
	Yes, Trello looks solid and so does github commit history.
	
Write a one-to-two-paragraph review of their models. Is their database schema
well-formulated?
	Their data model is quite simple, but I don't think it needs to be for their
		needs. All the basic bases are covered, but if time allows I can think
		of the following cool additions. I would love to see a category item
		and you can choose to play based on categories. Maybe also have another
		table for question translations so the game can be played in multiple
		languages.
	
Has there been an appropriate amount of code pushed into their client and server repos? Can you run the prototype and/or the database?
	It looked like they had a good number of commits, but I could not find a lot of
		progress on my musings. I didn't have a chance to see their presentation,
		so I may have missed something.

Was their design presentation effective? What worked? What didnâ€™t work? How would you rate their presentation relative to the others?
	Team A's presentation was not bad by any means. It was very helpful and
		informative, but it was very boring. Their app idea is not particularly
		inspiring and they did not try and offset that at all. Even just some
		more tonal variation could have helped.
	Their demo was particularly good though and I loved how they used the presentation
		pieces as their different projects.
