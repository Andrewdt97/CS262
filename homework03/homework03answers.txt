Is the service RESTful? If not, why not? If so, what key features make it RESTful.
	Yes, it is RESTful, meeting all criteria. It uses HTTP requests, remains stateless,
		is accessed with a directory structure, and returns JSON.
		
What endpoints implement actions that are idempotent? nullipotent?
	Idempotency and nullipotency have less to do with the specific HTTP methods. GET, 
		PUT and DELETE are idempotent, while GET is nullipotent. Looking at the Monopoly
		db, both players and player/{id} implement GET, making both have nullipotent
		implementation. player/{id} also has implementation for PUT and DELETE, which are
		both idempotent methods.
		
What evidence, if any, do you see of the commonly-cited impedance mismatch problem in 
object-relational information systems?
	A lot of the impedance mismatching comes how data is accessed and stored. I see
		that in the Java code, everything is manipulated in classes and then accessors
		are used to populate SQL statements.
		
Would the web service built in the lab be susceptible to SQL-injection attacks?
	Yes. Specifically looking at the getPlayer method. A user could easily add a true
		statement onto the end of the ID to return all players. A bit pointless because
		they could do that anyway, but a vulnerability none the less.
