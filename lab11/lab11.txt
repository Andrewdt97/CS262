Homework 1:
Lint:
 + Accessability:
 	- Recommendation: Add hints to edit texts
 	- Response: We have text lables, so in this case I don't think an update is neccesary.
 + Security:
 	- Reccomendation: Something about an attribute to save data between instances
 	- Response: Sounded logical so I went with the autmatic fix.
+ Usability:
	- Reccomendation: Add autoFill hint to editTexts
	- Response: We aren't using hints so not going to be helpful.

Java:
+ Declaration can be weaker
	- Response: A few variables can be private so I will make them such
+ Unused imports
	- Response: Axe them, violently.
+ "Redundant" casting
	- Response: findViewById can be sketchy some times, so I want to keep the cast.

Besides the reccomended fixes, I added doc strings to all public methods.

Homework 2:
This had a lot more suggestions, so I will just give a brief overview.

Lint:
	+ Correctness:
		- Reccomendation: Remove an attribute not supported in the minSDK
		- Response: It is needed for the functionality, so I would updated the min SDK.

		- Reccomendation: Invalid vector paths
		- Response: Add leading 0s to decimal numbers
Java:
	+ Error handling:
		- Reccomendation: Take return out of finally block
		- Response: Thinks it will mask exception which is not true.

Spelling:
	+ Typo:
		- Reccomendation: Typo'd the word "grade"
		- Response: Fix it
		
Doc strings also added.
